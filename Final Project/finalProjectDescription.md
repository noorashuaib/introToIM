**Exploring Sri Lanka**

In light of the pandemic, I appreciate how natural parks and museums have virtually opened their doors to the public, allowing us to appreciate natural wonders of the world that we might not have previously dreamt of visiting, but now when confined to our own homes, have the opportunity to explore even if virtually. I think it's really special that we are finding ways to appreciate the world around us even more now that we are kept away from it. The idea from my project stemmed from the fact that I'm not able to travel to Sri Lanka for summer this year, missing out on one of my favourite parts of the year, where I get to explore the beautiful island. But this just made me want to find a way to bring it closer, even if that meant through a screen. And so 'Exploring Sri Lanka' began.

My final project was really fun to plan, I was able to virtually revisit the different natural landmarks that make my homeland so special to me with all the memories they hold, and special those who visit Sri Lanka and catch a glimpse of the natural gems of the world. In creating the project, I wanted to make a tour that you could interact with, giving you the sense of what it feels like to walk through nature in Sri Lanka. The sounds in the project were of utmost importance to me, because the first thing I think about when I think of Sri Lankan nature are the natural melodies that envelop you in serenity. I was glad to be able to include these sounds in my project. Initially, I also planned to be able to pan through the sites using a zoom function, but given time constraints, and some problems I faced with the circle sound markers when zooming, I decided to table this feature. I was also able to include small descriptions of the different sites to allow people to appreciate the landmarks they were going through, understanding aspects of the atmosphere that couldn't be coded. Including a quiz at the end was something I wanted to do as a fun way of encouraging people to read these descriptions, as well as a way of allowing people to actively engage with the project apart from clicking on different features. 

Overall, I am really happy with the end product of my final project. The final seal of approval was when I showed it to my Dad, who laughed when hearing the bird calls and said it brought back so many memories. My aim of the project was to allow people who had been to Sri Lanka to feel at home again, even for a second, and to allow people who haven't been to Sri Lanka to experience a slice of my home, in theirs.
