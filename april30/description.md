**Recreating Architecture **

Iranian Architecture is incredibly detailed, the more you look at it, the more detail emerges. I wanted to create a way to appreciate these details by highlighting them in a different way. And that's exactly what I did. Using the tint function in Processing, I gave the image different highlights so that different details stood out in different colours given how colourful the original image was. 

My initial idea for the code was to create a way to zoom into the image. I struggled with doing this, so I looked for other ways to highlight the details of the architecture. My code randomizes the tints whenever the mouse is clicked, so with a darker tint, the brighter parts of the image become more visible and vice versa. To work more on the code, I might like to try adding gradients to the image, so that it would be possible to compare the brighter details with the darker details in the same frame. I'd also like to figure out how to zoom in to the image using resize so that the details could also be observed better without emphasizing the brighter or darker shades of the design.
